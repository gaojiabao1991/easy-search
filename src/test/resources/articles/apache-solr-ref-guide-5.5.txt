    Apache Solr Reference Guide

    This reference guide describes Apache Solr, the open source solution for search. You can download Apache
    Solr from the Solr website at http://lucene.apache.org/solr/.
    This Guide contains the following sections:
     
    Getting Started: This section guides you through the installation and setup of Solr.
    Using the Solr Administration User Interface: This section introduces the Solr Web-based user interface.
    From your browser you can view configuration files, submit queries, view logfile settings and Java environment
    settings, and monitor and control distributed configurations.
    Documents, Fields, and Schema Design: This section describes how Solr organizes its data for indexing. It
    explains how a Solr schema defines the fields and field types which Solr uses to organize data within the
    document files it indexes.
    Understanding Analyzers, Tokenizers, and Filters: This section explains how Solr prepares text for indexing
    and searching. Analyzers parse text and produce a stream of tokens, lexical units used for indexing and
    searching. Tokenizers break field data down into tokens. Filters perform other transformational or selective work
    on token streams.
    Indexing and Basic Data Operations: This section describes the indexing process and basic index operations,
    such as commit, optimize, and rollback.
     
    Searching: This section presents an overview of the search process in Solr. It describes the main components
    used in searches, including request handlers, query parsers, and response writers. It lists the query parameters
    that can be passed to Solr, and it describes features such as boosting and faceting, which can be used to
    fine-tune search results.
    The Well-Configured Solr Instance: This section discusses performance tuning for Solr. It begins with an
    overview of the solrconfig.xml file, then tells you how to configure cores with solr.xml, how to configure
    the Lucene index writer, and more.
    Managing Solr: This section discusses important topics for running and monitoring Solr. Other topics include
    how to back up a Solr instance, and how to run Solr with Java Management Extensions (JMX).
    SolrCloud: This section describes the newest and most exciting of Solr's new features, SolrCloud, which
    provides comprehensive distributed capabilities.
    Legacy Scaling and Distribution: This section tells you how to grow a Solr distribution by dividing a large index
    into sections called shards, which are then distributed across multiple servers, or by replicating a single index
    across multiple services.
    Client APIs: This section tells you how to access Solr through various client APIs, including JavaScript, JSON,
    and Ruby.

    About This Guide

    This guide describes all of the important features and functions of Apache Solr. It is free to download from http://l
    ucene.apache.org/solr/.
    Designed to provide high-level documentation, this guide is intended to be more encyclopedic and less of a
    cookbook. It is structured to address a broad spectrum of needs, ranging from new developers getting started to
    well-experienced developers extending their application or troubleshooting. It will be of use at any point in the
    application life cycle, for whenever you need authoritative information about Solr.
    The material as presented assumes that you are familiar with some basic search concepts and that you can read
    XML. It does not assume that you are a Java programmer, although knowledge of Java is helpful when working
    directly with Lucene or when developing custom extensions to a Lucene/Solr installation.

    Special Inline Notes

    Special notes are included throughout these pages.

                      Yellow notes are further clarifications of important points to keep in mind while using
                      Solr.


     Tip
                      Notes with a green background are Helpful Tips.


     Warning
                      Notes with a red background are warning messages.


    Hosts and Port Examples

    The default port when running Solr is 8983. The samples, URLs and screenshots in this guide may show
    different ports, because the port number that Solr uses is configurable. If you have not customized your
    installation of Solr, please make sure that you use port 8983 when following the examples, or configure your own
    installation to use the port numbers shown in the examples. For information about configuring port numbers, see 
    Managing Solr.
    Similarly, URL examples use 'localhost' throughout; if you are accessing Solr from a location remote to the server
    hosting Solr, replace 'localhost' with the proper domain or IP where Solr is running.

    Paths

    Path information is given relative to solr.home, which is the location under the main Solr installation where
    Solr's collections and their conf and data directories are stored. When running the various examples

    Getting Started

    Solr makes it easy for programmers to develop sophisticated, high-performance search applications with
    advanced features such as faceting (arranging search results in columns with numerical counts of key terms).
    Solr builds on another open source search technology: Lucene, a Java library that provides indexing and search
    technology, as well as spellchecking, hit highlighting and advanced analysis/tokenization capabilities. Both Solr
    and Lucene are managed by the Apache Software Foundation (www.apache.org).
    The Lucene search library currently ranks among the top 15 open source projects and is one of the top 5 Apache
    projects, with installations at over 4,000 companies. Lucene/Solr downloads have grown nearly ten times over
    the past three years, with a current run-rate of over 6,000 downloads a day. The Solr search server, which
    provides application builders a ready-to-use search platform on top of the Lucene search library, is the fastest
    growing Lucene sub-project. Apache Lucene/Solr offers an attractive alternative to the proprietary licensed
    search and discovery software vendors.
    This section helps you get Solr up and running quickly, and introduces you to the basic Solr architecture and
    features. It covers the following topics:
    Installing Solr: A walkthrough of the Solr installation process.
    Running Solr: An introduction to running Solr. Includes information on starting up the servers, adding documents,
    and running queries.
    A Quick Overview: A high-level overview of how Solr works.
    A Step Closer: An introduction to Solr's home directory and configuration options.
    Solr Start Script Reference: a complete reference of all of the commands and options available with the bin/solr
    script.
     
    Installing Solr

    This section describes how to install Solr. You can install Solr in any system where a suitable Java Runtime
    Environment (JRE) is available, as detailed below. Currently this includes Linux, OS X, and Microsoft Windows.
    The instructions in this section should work for any platform, with a few exceptions for Windows as noted.

    Got Java?

    You will need the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 1.7 or higher. At a command line, check your Java
    version like this:

        $ java -version
        java version "1.8.0_60"
        Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_60-b27)
        Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.60-b23, mixed mode)

    The exact output will vary, but you need to make sure you meet the minimum version requirement. We also
    recommend choosing a version that is not end-of-life from its vendor. If you don't have the required version, or if
    the java command is not found, download and install the latest version from Oracle at http://www.oracle.com/tec
    hnetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html.
